<h2> Flag of Malaysia by Jerusha Stewart </h2>

<p>The first step in the process of making the Malaysian flag is finding the meausrements. </p>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Construction_sheet_of_Flag_of_Malaysia.svg" width="400px" height="200px">
 
-   This is the Flag of Malaysia and really when I'm done with my flag I expect a four becuase I made the professional flag.




## Current output

* * *
![Flag](file:///C:/Users/JS/Pictures/Screenshot%20(76).png)
* * *


include image
size = 100

width = size * 14
height = size * 7

rectangle(width,height,"solid","white")

stripe-height = height / 9.5
stripe-width = width

rectangle(stripe-width, stripe-height, "solid", "red")

box-height = size * 3
box-width = size * 6

* * *

-   The size multiplies the acurate fittings to chnage however I want it too and the rectangles make the stripes and background of the flag white background and red stripes.

 



## Program code
include image
size = 100

width = size * 14
height = size * 7

rectangle(width,height,"solid","white")

stripe-height = height / 9.5
stripe-width = width

rectangle(stripe-width, stripe-height, "solid", "red")

box-height = size * 3
box-width = size * 6

rectangle(box-width, box-height,"solid", "blue")
